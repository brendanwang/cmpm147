				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For the dungeon generator, I tried to recreate one of the images I found on google.  The image was pretty simple so there 
					was a lot to build off of.  I did my best to recreate the color scheme given the tilemap.
				</p>
				<p>For the overworld generator, I was trying to replicate something you would find in the game Stardew Valley. 
					Since the tilemap looked pretty similar to something from that game, I decided to try my best to replicate a cliffside
					 overlooking a river.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Dungeon Generator</p>
				<p>The dungeon generator creates unique and intricate underground environments by using random generation.  Random generation 
					is used for carving out rooms and connecting each and every one with corridors.  These corridors are carved out between 
					adjacent rooms.  This process utilizes algorithms to ensure that rooms are strategically placed and interconnected.  I also 
					used Math.random() functions to randomly generate artifacts within each dungeon room.
				</p>
				<p>Overworld Generator</p>
				<p>The overworld generator constructs a landscape which generates a grid-like terrain.  Using generative techniques, different 
					regions of the map are identified and populated with specific terrain features like trees or water bubbles.  These features 
					are based on predefined rules and probabilities.  
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project by myself but had to rely on other classmates for help regarding the grid system that the tilemap 
					used.  Overall, this experiment was pretty frustrating since I was trying to figure out how everything worked for hours. 
					I also found it pretty frustrating how you had to guess each coordinate for each tile within the tilemap which led to 
					mostly debugging and getting the correct placement on things.
