                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This experiment, I'm trying to replicate the image above without the tree.  The results for my experiment are at the BOTTOM 
					of the page 
					for some mysterious reason.  So scroll to the bottom if you want to see my experiment results. If I have extra time, 
					I'll update this if I'm able to find a fix.  But right now, all that 
					matters is my experiment is complete and is showing a cool output.
				</p>
				<p>I used the p5.js library in order to start my journey in replicating a sunset horizon in some sort of savanna desert. 
					I used various types of random generation and Perlin noise in order to create the scene.
				</p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>This experiment represents a dynamic scene that is generated consisting of elements like clouds, stars, mountains, grass, 
					and the sun which has a unique glowing effect.  The 'setup()' function initializes the canvas and sets up a button 
					for scene regeneration.  When this button is clicked, the scene randomly generates another scene.
				</p>
				<p>The 'draw()' function is responsible for rendering the scene as it begins by resetting the random seed and clearing 
					the background.  Then, it draws a gradient sky using linear interpolation between two colors.  Stars are also randomly 
					generated across the canvas, each with a randomized size, giving the impression of a night sky.
				</p>
				<p>Next, the sun's glow is drawn using translucent ellipses which are positioned around the sun.  Mountain ranges 
					are generated using Perlin noise to create smooth, natural looking peaks.  I also positioned the clouds in a way 
					where they travel from left to right of the canvas at varying speeds.  I also used a similar technique when generating 
					the blades of grass.  I also made them move from left to right, giving the scene a sense of life.
				</p>
				<p>I created initialization functions which set up initial parameters for everything in the scene.  The 'reimagineScene()' 
					function then resets these parameters, allowing for the regeneration of a new scene on button press.
				</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I worked on this experiment alone and not going to lie, the experiment itself wasn't too bad.  The hard part of this was 
					getting my portfolio and website to work and actually display correctly.  Also, all this writing is making me tired as I just 
					want to turn in my experiment.
