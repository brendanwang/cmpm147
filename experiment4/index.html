                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>In my first generator, I wanted to create a housing simulator for UCSC.  The canvas is supposed to be the UCSC campus with the trees.  
                    As you click around the canvas, you spawn in more housing.
                </p>
                <p>In my second generator, I used my first generator as a template to create an igloo map inspired by Club Penguin.  As you click around 
                    the canvas, you spawn penguins.
                </p>
                <p>In my third generator, I wanted to switch things up.  I was inspired by the Dune movie sandworm that swallowed the spice collector.  
                    I created a sandy environment and added an animation that makes the adjacent tiles to the clicked tile animate in a wave motion.
                </p>

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>Generator 1</p>
                <p>This code defines a simple tile-based environment where each tile represents different elements, such as trees, houses, and empty space.  
                    The code handles tile clicking.  When a tile is clicked, houses are spawned not only on the clicked tile but also its neighboring tiles.  
                    This is achieved by iterating over predefined offsets representing the neighboring tiles and assigning a random number of houses to each one.
                </p>
                <p>Generator 2</p>
                <p>This code is almost identical to the first generators code but is has a different color scheme as well as shapes for the randomly generated 
                    buildings across the canvas.  I opted to go with an ice theme by changing the rgb values of the tiles as well as creating new shapes for both 
                    the buildings and spawns that are generated upon each click. 
                </p>
                <p>Generator 3</p>
                <p>This code creates a visually dynamic tile-based environment where tiles display different colors and respond to user interaction by undergoing 
                    a wave-like animation when clicked.  The environment's appearance is determined by a combination of predefined colors, animation logic, and 
                    random generation based on the world seed.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I worked on this experiment alone so I contributed to everything by myself.  One high point of the project was that it was pretty easy to get started on this project as compared to Experiment 3.  The instructions seemed pretty straightforward on how to create an infinite world generator.  However there were quite a few low points to the project.  I found it pretty difficult to load a tile map from the internet into glitch.com.  I’m pretty sure I was implementing the preload function incorrectly but I couldn’t seem to figure this part out.  And if I ever did get the tile map to load, another challenge would be drawing the actual tiles in the generator since I would probably have to figure out the coordinates of the tiles in the tile map.  Another low to the project was transferring everything from glitch.com to my portfolio website again.  It seems like there is a trend of me having a difficult time transferring everything from glitch to the portfolio.  It’s not always a straightforward task and requires me to do a lot of tinkering just to get it to display correctly on the page.  Sometimes, I find this incredibly frustrating since I just want to turn in my assignment without wasting more time tinkering around since I have the link to the working generator(s) on glitch.com.
